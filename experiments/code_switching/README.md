### Start by computing the part-of-speech tags of all the captions and NLVR2 sentences.

Use the `multicombo_env` environment and run the `extract_lang_pos.sh` script

### Bilingual dictionaries

The dictionaries are available in [panlex_dictionaries/](panlex_dictionaries).

### Analyses

The `dictionaries_coverage_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains the dictionaries coverage for each caption file and for the NLVR2 dataset.

The `embeddings_similarity.ipynb` contains the results of the experiment that compare word embeddings similarites for various dictionaries and model.
