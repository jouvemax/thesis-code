# Panlex dictionaries

Bilingual dictionaries with part-of-speech tags are available as `.pickle` files, the format is `lang1_to_lang2_dict.pickle`.

The raw translations were obtained from the list of [English words](english_words.txt) using the [plexy repository](https://github.com/fdschmidt93/plexy). They follow the format `langA2langB.txt`.

The dictionaries can be recomputed using the `build_lang_dictionary.sh` script.
