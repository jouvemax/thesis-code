# Varying amount of finetuning data

1. Use the same pretrained models as in [experiment_pretraining/](../experiment_pretraining)

2. Finetuning

Scripts for finetuning are in [iglue/experiments/zero_shot/ctrl_muniter/marvl/experiment_1/varying_finetune_data](../../../iglue/experiments/zero_shot/ctrl_muniter/marvl/experiment_1/varying_finetune_data).

**Use the `iglue_env`environment.**

3. Results can be observed in the `results.ipynb` notebook.
