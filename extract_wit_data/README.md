# Extract WIT data

**Use the `marvl_env` environment for the following steps.**

1. Download WIT training entries from the official WIT [repository](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit/blob/main/DATA.md).

2. Extract entries for the languages of interest (Indonesian, Swahili, Tamil, Turkish and Mandarin Chinese)

Use the `extract_marvl-lang_entries.sh` script.

It will create one pickle file per language and assign a unique id to all entries.

3. Download images
